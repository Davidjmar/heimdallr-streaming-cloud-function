# heimdallr-streaming-cloud-function
A plug and play cloud function to deploy and use for passing your Particle IO to bigquery

This is intended to be as basic and starter friendly as possible. Intentions are to allow users to collect data from their particle Boron, pass 1 seconds worth of data to pubsub events, and pass the data of those pubsub events to bigquery for ML processing.

Use it as you need! Go buck wild and sko buffs!
